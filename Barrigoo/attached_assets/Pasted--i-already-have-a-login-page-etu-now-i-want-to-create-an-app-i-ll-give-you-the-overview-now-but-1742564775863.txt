Build the initial prototype
Integration with AI features (to be added by user)
Advanced analytics and reporting
Social sharing features
Export functionality for progress reports

Absolutely! Let me propose what we'll build for you.

Implement admin and user dashboards for the food tracking application. Adds UI components for calorie counting, habit tracking, and system analytics.
Can you check if the application is loading properly? You should see a Dashboard with sections for Calorie Counter, Food Habits, and Today's Meals. Can you confirm these sections are visible?

I'll verify if the updated dashboard layout with the new circular calorie counter, daily goals, and meal summaries is working correctly. The layout should now look more like Yazio with:

A centered half-circle calorie progress bar
Daily goals with a link to the calendar
Organized meal summaries by time of day

Searched for "Search for uploaded ZIP files or assets with login/register implementations"
I understand that I need to properly examine the uploaded login/register code files. However, I notice that I'm unable to directly read the contents of the ZIP files in the uploaded assets. Could you please share the specific login/register code that you want me to integrate? That way, I can ensure I'm implementing exactly the secure implementation you provided while maintaining our enhanced features like social login and proper error handling.

everything is alright stop it
